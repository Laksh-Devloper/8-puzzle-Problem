This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one blank space. The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles from a given initial configuration to a target configuration by sliding the tiles into the blank space.

The project includes both the problem representation and various search algorithms to solve the puzzle. It serves as an educational resource for those interested in learning about search algorithms and problem-solving strategies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory
3. Run the `game.py` script: `python game.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to input the initial and target puzzle configurations and select a search algorithm.
5. The program will display the steps to solve the puzzle using the chosen algorithm.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
